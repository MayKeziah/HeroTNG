							<h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
							<p>We implemented all the listed requirements from the assignment page.</p>
							<hr>
							<h3>Controls</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Key-M toggles between mouse or keyboard control.</li> 
								<li>Mouse mode follows the cursor, keyboard mode uses WSAD</li>
								<li>Space Bar spawns an egg. An egg is destroyed when</li>						
								<ul><li>It reaches the bounds of the world</li>
								<li>It collides with an enemy</li>
								<li>It collides with a waypoint</li></ul>
								
							</ul> 
							<h3>Waypoints</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>There are six waypoint objects in the system, names A to F.</li> 
								<li>When a waypoint object collides with an egg, it loses 25% of its opacity. 
								This can be implemented by decrease the alpha channel of the SpriteRenderer 
								color by 0.25.</li>
								<li>On the forth collision with an egg, a waypoint object will 
								disappear and re-position itself in a new point that is randomly located at 
								+ or - 15 units in both X and Y from the initial position of the waypoint.</li>
								<li>H-key hides and shows waypoints</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h3>Enemies</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>There are always 10 enemies in the world</li>
								<li>Enemy is destroyed when if it comes in contact with the Hero or when hit with an egg</li>
								<li>When an enemy is destroyed, a new one spawns</li>	
								<li>An enemy sequences through the waypoints either sequentially (from A to F then back to A again) or randomly (waypoint chosen randomly)</li>	
								<li>J-Key switches between sequential waypoints and random waypoints</li>	
								<li>When a waypoint is moved, the enemy should move towards the new position</li>	
							</ul>
							<h3>Display</h3>
							The display must include the game information as in the example (mouse/keyboard state, number of enemies touched, number of eggs in the world, number of enemies destroyed, cooldown for the egg)

							<!-- <div class="features">

									<h3>Egg</h3>
									<p>Eggs spawned with a space bar and destroyed when out of bounds or collide with enemy/waypoint</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Enemy</h3>
									<p>When a waypoint is moved, the enemy should move towards the new position. 
										J-Key toggles between sequential (ie from A to F then A again) or random waypoints. 
										Enemy is destroyed when collide with Hero or an egg. New enemy spawned when enemy destroyed. 
                                                                        </p>

									<h3>Waypoint</h3>
									<p>
									    Waypoint loses 25% of its opacity for each collision with an egg. On the 4th collision with an egg, 
									    waypoint object will disappear and re-position itself in a new random point +/- 15 units in both X 
									    and Y from the initial position of the waypoint. H-key hides and shows waypoints
									</p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Screen Controls</h3>
									<p>
									   Text display includes the following game information: mouse/WASD, number of enemies touched/destroyed, 
									   number of eggs as well as counter for egg collision. In addition, Key M toggles between mouse or WASD control.
